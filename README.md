# Motion-Estimation
In this Project we implement two motion estimation algorithm:1- Full Search Motion Estimation 2- Fast Search Motion Estimation (Cross Search Algorithm).<br />
In DemoExpriment1I.m we Do Full Search motion estimation between frame2 with reference to frame1 and calculate the motion compensated frame quality with search windows (4 pixels/frame, 8 pixels/frame, 16 pixels/frame, 32 pixles/frame) with block size equal to 8 pixel, then change block sizes of: 4,8,16 and 32 pixels with search window 16 pixels/frame. <br />
In DemoExpriment1II.m we Do Fast Search motion estimation between frame2 with reference to frame1 and calculate the motion compensated frame quality with search windows (4 pixels/frame, 8 pixels/frame, 16 pixels/frame, 32 pixles/frame) with block size equal to 8 pixel, then change block sizes of: 4,8,16 and 32 pixels with search window 16 pixels/frame. <br />
In bidirectional.m we do bi-directional motion compensation between frame 2 and reference of frame 1 and motioncompensated frame 3, with a search size of 16 pixels/frame (integer accuracy) for full search motion estimation and fast search motion estimation. <br />
